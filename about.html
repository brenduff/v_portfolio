      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>This website contains the beginning chapters of a fantasy novel I am working on and am excited to share. I also drafted a mock query letter I plan to use to try to get published along with research and my plans on how to navigate the publishing industry.</p>

      <h2>My Writing Journey</h2>
      <p>I have loved creating and writing stories since I've learned how to read. I am just a short time away from receiving my Bacherlor's in English Literature. After graduation, I plan to work to finish my novel and get it published. This capstone project is the first major step in that journey.</p>
